SquareWell
==========

Nick Walker

Purpose:

This program simulates the wave-like behavior of a particle in an infinite square well. The user must input a range of stationary states, allowing for the simulation of single wave numbers or a superposition of wavenumbers. In the future, this might be made a bit more accurate and interactive for the user. The real wave is plotted in blue, the imaginary in red, and the probability density function in black.

Development:

Development may or may not continue on this.
